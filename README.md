# ts-full-stack-ref-monorepo
TypeScript full stack reference monorepo of 2022.

Intended to:
- be structured as monorepo project with a clear separation of concerns yet being still simple enough to wrap a head around
- use Express on backend, TypeORM and postgres as database
- use React on frontend
- use Docker
- common tasks as libraries: configuration, logger, error handling, jwt-veryfing, validation, testing
- follow recent best practices

Heavily inspired by recent developments of [Practica.js Best Practice Starter](https://practica.dev/) which is based on [Node.js Best Practices repository](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices)
